# Overlap and cross-study analyses

#### Reproducibility across multiple datasets:

1. Correlation on lipid concentration
2. Correlation on double bond %mol
3. Commonly detected lipids between datasets
4. Correlation on lipid effect size change with age across studies
5. Correlation on double bond composition effect size change with age across studies

#### Identify the most robust age-related changes:

1. Lipid effect size change with age across all _in vitro_ datasets (_in vitro summary_)
2. Lipid effect size change between _in vitro summary_ and _in vivo_
3. Lipid effect size change between _in vitro summary_, _in vivo_ and DESI-MSI
4. Lipid effect size change between _in vitro summary_ and lipidyzer
5. Lipid effect size change between _in vitro summary_ and GPMV
6. Double bond composition effect size change with age across all _in vitro_ datasets (_in vitro summary_)
7. Double bond composition effect size change between _in vitro summary_ and _in vivo_
8. Double bond composition effect size change between _in vitro summary_ and GPMV

#### Principal component analysis across studies

#### Heatmap on significant lipids in different datasets

#### Class concentration composition in different studies

#### Age-related changes per lipid class

#### Abundance of significant lipids and double bond composition features (based on _in vitro_ summary analysis)

#### Lipidomic aging signature by meta-analysis across datasets
