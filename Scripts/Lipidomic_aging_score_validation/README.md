# Validation of lipidomic aging signature (from this study) with an external dataset

"A metabolome atlas of the aging mouse brain"

Ding _et al._, _Nature Communication_ 2021

### Pre-processing steps are in the following order:

* Organize data from the brian for downstream analysis
* Calculate Z score of lipid features across all brain regions of different ages in both male and female mice
* Double bond composition analysis across all samples
* Calculate Z score of double bond composition features across all brain regions of different ages in both male and female mice
* Use the combined set of lipidomic signature (include individual lipids and double bond composition features) to calculate lipidomic aging score
